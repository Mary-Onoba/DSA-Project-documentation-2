## Analysis Tasks
1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and 
departments 
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender 
3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If 
there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of 
management 
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay 
employees a minimum of $90,000 
- Does Palmoria meet this requirement? 
- Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example: 
- How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000, 
etc.? 
- Also visualize this by regions
