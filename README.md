# DSA-Project-documentation-2
This project delivers a comprehensive Power BI report that visually represents critical workforce metrics and enables Palmoria’s management to take targeted action in support of gender equity and fair compensation practices.

## Project objective
The objective of this Power BI analysis is to examine Palmoria Group’s HR data with a focus on identifying and addressing gender-related disparities across departments and regions. This includes evaluating gender distribution, performance ratings, salary structures, regulatory compliance with minimum wage standards, and fair bonus allocations.
The analysis aims to deliver actionable, data-driven insights through interactive visualizations that will help Palmoria’s leadership:
Promote gender equity within the organization,
Detect and address potential gender pay gaps,
Ensure compliance with compensation regulations,
Implement fair performance-based bonus distribution,
Support strategic decision-making to foster an inclusive and accountable workplace culture.

## Data set used
<a href="https://github.com/Mary-Onoba/DSA-Project-documentation-2/blob/main/Palmoria%20Group%20emp%20DSA%20Projecct.pbix">Palmoria Group Employee Data</a>

## Analysis Tasks
1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and 
departments 
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender 
3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If 
there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of 
management 
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay 
employees a minimum of $90,000 
- Does Palmoria meet this requirement? 
- Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example: 
- How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000, 
etc.? 
- Also visualize this by regions

## Process
- Verified the data for missing values like blank salaries, "NULL" departments, and undisclosed genders, then cleaned them accordingly.
- Ensured data consistency and correctness across data types, formats, and values. Replaced missing gender entries with "Undisclosed".
- Created calculated columns and DAX measures to address key questions on gender distribution, ratings, salary structure, and bonus calculations.
- Built multiple visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, histograms, scatter plots) and combined them into an interactive Power BI dashboard for insights and storytelling.

 ## Project Insights
- Gender Imbalance: The organization has a visible gender imbalance across regions and departments, with certain regions showing significant underrepresentation of one gender.
- Undisclosed Gender Entries: A number of employees did not disclose their gender, which affects clarity in workforce diversity reporting.
- Gender Pay Gap: There are noticeable disparities in average salaries between genders, particularly in specific departments and regions, indicating potential gender pay gaps that require attention.
- Performance Ratings by Gender: Average performance ratings were similar across genders, suggesting that pay gaps may not be performance-based.
- Salary Compliance Issue: Several employees earn below the newly established minimum salary threshold of $90,000, especially in certain regions, which could expose the company to regulatory penalties.
- Bonus Allocation: Bonus payments based on ratings revealed regional disparities in total payouts, which may correlate with performance trends or workforce composition in those regions.
- Need for Policy Reforms: These findings highlight the need for stronger HR policies on gender equality, compensation equity, and employee data completeness

  ## Conclusion
The Palmoria Group HR Analysis has uncovered critical workforce patterns, particularly around gender representation, salary structure, and performance-linked compensation. The findings clearly show a gender imbalance in some regions and departments, as well as salary disparities that suggest a gender pay gap. These issues, if left unaddressed, could affect employee morale, retention, and the company’s public image especially in light of recent media attention.
Additionally, the organization falls short of complying with the newly introduced $90,000 minimum salary regulation in some cases. While performance ratings are generally consistent across genders, the bonus allocation process could benefit from more transparency and standardization.

To build a more equitable and compliant workforce, Palmoria must take active steps to:

- Review and address pay discrepancies,
- Promote inclusive hiring and data reporting practices,
- Regularly audit salary structures by gender and region,
- Ensure full compliance with evolving labor regulations,
With these data-driven insights, Palmoria is now well-positioned to take strategic HR actions that support fairness, compliance, and long-term business success.
